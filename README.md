# computer-graphics

A basic JavaScript application which allows the user to use some computer-graphics-related algorithms, (e.g., Bresenham, ScanLine). You can see this application working by [clicking here](https://imatheussm.github.io/computer-graphics/index.html).

This application was developed by the following authors:

 - Igor Matheus S. Moreira ([@imatheussm](https://github.com/imatheussm)); and
 - Renan F. Cunha ([@renan-cunha](https://github.com/renan-cunha)).
 
## Requirements

This application requires `jQuery` and `Math.js` to work. Such modules are already contained in this project, so that they remain unaffected by external issues. We thank the developers of these modules for making the development of this application easier.
